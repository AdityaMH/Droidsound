 About those MinixSF formats:
 
 * They usually need an additional file that has an extension .???lib. In some rare cases the .???lib filename have been changed causing the song fail to load. In order to fix this, you need to manually download the whole song and change the .???lib filename. The correct .???lib filename is always inside the .minixSF file. In most cases, only the case-sensitiveness is the problem.

Needs lots of work still.
