<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Droidsound-E help page.</h2>

<p>This page is dedicated to Droidsound-E documentation and it's main purpose is to help users to tackle problems at the beginning.</p>

<h2><a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The main menu</h2>
Starting from version 1.65 the main menu will look like this when installing it for the first time.<br><br>
<img src="images/dse_mainmenu.png" alt=""/><br>
<p>As it can be seen, the Local Mediastore is no more there but it can be added back from the "New" button for those who needs it. 
Also there is a new item, DSEMusic, which is a pre-defined mountpoint for music.</p>

<p>
The pre-defined mountpoint is pointing to /mnt/sdcard/DSEMusic, so all you need to do is copy your files there and rescan the folder.</p>

Another thing that is missing is Favorites.plist. This is because there is a dedicated playlist tab on the right.<br><br>

<h3><a name="searches" class="anchor" href="#searches"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Filebrowser</h3>
<p>
The application supports mounting folders as browsable directories. It works by clicking the PLUS sign on the action bar
and choosing Filebrowser. A new window appears where user can input the mountpoint and mountpoint name. Clicking the 
mountpoint box opens folder selector. Select your folder and click Select Folder button. After that, enter the name 
for your mountpoint and click OK. 
</p>
<h3><a name="searches" class="anchor" href="#searches"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modland DB</h3>
<p>
By clicking this item a new dialog will show up asking for a name for the Modland offline DB. Since there can be only one at a time, 
just select internal or external memory and click OK. It will then download allmods.zip from modland and start indexing entries from it. This will take around 5-10 minutes.
After indexing a new entry will show up in the main menu. Inside the ModDB it looks like user would be browsing the modland archive online.
</p>
<h3><a name="searches" class="anchor" href="#searches"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Network Link</h3>

<h2><a name="searches" class="anchor" href="#searches"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Searches</h2>

<p>
The search screen shows the latest search results, and also provides a button for searching. The search screen works similar to the Browser.
You can search for song titles or composers when searching the song databases.The following commands are available in search screen:
<ul>
Every search needs a prefix as shown below.<br>

<li> .c = searches by composer (local files)</li>
<li> .t = searches by title (local files)</li>
<li> .r = searches songs online from http://remix.kwed.org</li>
<li> .a = searches songs online from http://amigaremix.com</li>
<li> .h = searches sid songs online from http://hvsc.de, sometimes this is slow</li>
<li> .i = searches radio stations from IceCast</li>
<li> .m = searches by various DB entry. Usually helpful with filename search</li>
<li> ,c = searches by composer (Modland files)</li>
<li> ,t = searches by title (Modland files)</li>
<li> ,n = searches by composer and title (Modland files)</li>

<br>
Examples: <li>.cskaven</li>
          <li>.aturrican</li>
		  <li>.hJeroen</li>
		  <li>.mfilename, stars.xm</li>
		  <li>.mtitle, commando</li>
		  <li>.ivideo game</li>
</ul>
NOTE: playing online songs happens by streaming. Only SID files will be downloaded since they are very small in size.
</p>
<h2><a name="archives" class="anchor" href="#archives"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Archive support</h2>
<p>
Droidsound-E has support for .zip, .7z, .rar and .gz files. These archives are treated as directories. Maximum supported
archive size is approximately 2GB. There are some limitations, for example ZIP supports only Deflate compression and 
7zip support LZMA/LZMA2/PPMd. Other compresson methods will make Droidsound-E behave bad. Also it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use
SOLID-BLOCK archiving for .7z files. Those archives are memory consuming and very slow to process especially on mobile device.
</p>



<h2><a name="ringtones" class="anchor" href="#ringtones"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ringtones</h2>
<p>


To create a ringtone from a song, long press the song and select Create Ringtone and choose the desired options.
Default format is WAV 22KHz mono, select HQ for Stereo 44KHz.

If you want to create a ringtone from another subtune then the default one, you need to use the PLUS button on 
the play screen to add a specific song to your playlist, and then create the ringtone from that playlist entry instead.
</p>

<h2><a name="upgrading" class="anchor" href="#upgrading"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Upgrading from earlier version</h2>

If you are upgrading from earlier Droidsound-E version, there shouldn't be any problems. Rescanning will be performed as usual since the version has changed.
<br><br>
If you are upgrading from normal Droidsound, the following steps should be done:
<p>
<ul>
	<li> Backup your files from the following folders:
<ul>
	<li>/mnt/sdcard/droidsound</li>
	<li>/mnt/sdcard/MODS</li> 
	</ul>
<li>Delete above folders after backup.</li>
<li>Uninstall Droidsound, clean cache and everything related to it.</li>

<li>Restart Droidsound-E application, it will recreate all the files it needs.</li>
</ul>
</p> 

<h2><a name="tips" class="anchor" href="#tips"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li> If you don't like to keep rescanning enabled, rescan your files manually if you move them around.</li>
<li> Sometimes it is a good idea to keep small files insize a ZIP, it scans faster.</li>
<li> If Droidsound-E crashes when you start it for the first time, don't panic, try restarting it.</li>
<li> Got unexpected crash when using Droidsound-E? Try to remember how you made it crash and e-mail me the details.</li>
</ul>
